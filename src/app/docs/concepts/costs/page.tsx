            Esy records cost per provider call, not per run, and every number has a documented source.
            Budgets sit in front of execution: a run that would breach one is refused before it spends
            anything.

      <h2>Cost is not price</h2>
      <p>
        What you see here is <strong>cost</strong> — what the providers charged to make the thing.
        It is not a price to a customer, and Esy does not compute margin for you. Every figure traces
        back to a model, a quantity, and a unit rate that was in effect at the time.
      </p>

      <h2>What one run costs</h2>
      <p>
        A finished run itemises its own bill. This is the real ledger from the{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/quickstart">Quickstart</Link> run:

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/runs/{run_id}" language="json">

      <p>
        The render was $0.0046 and the two checks around it were $0.0031 together — the quality apparatus
        cost two-thirds of what the image did. That ratio is normal for gated workflows, and it is the
        thing to look at before concluding a workflow is expensive.
      </p>

      <h2>The three cost states</h2>
      <p>
        Each ledger row moves through the same three states. There are three — not four.

      <h2>Reading spend</h2>
      <p>
        <code>GET /v1/costs</code> aggregates across runs. Filter by workspace, project, workflow, or

      </p>

      <h2>Budgets</h2>
      <p>
        A budget is a limit attached to a scope, with a period and an enforcement mode. It is evaluated{' '}
        <em>before</em> a run executes, so a refusal costs nothing.

      <h2>What a refusal looks like</h2>

        {refused}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        The body carries everything you need to explain the refusal to a person: which budget, which
        rule, the limit, the spend so far, and what this run would have cost.{' '}
        <code>reason</code> is one of <code>per_run_cap_exceeded</code>, <code>hard_stop</code>,{' '}
        <code>allow_overage_exceeded</code>, or <code>allow_one_more_exhausted</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refusals are durable. <code>GET /v1/budgets/{'{budget_id}'}/refusals</code> lists what a budget
        turned away — useful when someone asks why a batch came back short.
      </p>

      <Callout title="A failed run still costs money" tone="warning">
        Budgets stop runs from <em>starting</em>. They cannot refund a run that failed at its last gate
        after paying for a render. When you plan spend for a gated workflow, plan for the failures too.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Estimating before you commit</h2>
      <p>
        For a single run, the server estimates for you at creation and refuses with a <code>402</code>{' '}
        if a budget would be breached — nothing is spent. For batches, use a{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/orders">Generation Order</Link>: it is created in the{' '}
        <code>planned</code> state with <code>estimatedCostUsd</code> already filled in, and the budget is
        checked both when you create it and again when you start it. Read the estimate, then decide —
        finding the limit at item 400 of 500 is an expensive way to learn it.
      </p>
