            Intake is what you hand a run. Each workflow declares the fields it accepts, and Esy
            validates your payload against that declaration before a single provider call is made — so a
            typo costs you a <code>422</code> rather than a render.
          </>
        }
      />

      <h2>Reading the schema</h2>
      <p>
        Fetch any workflow&rsquo;s contract and you get its <code>intakeSchema</code>: a flat list of
        fields, each with a type, a required flag, and — where the field is constrained — its allowed
        values and default.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="intakeSchema, from generate-coloring-page" language="json">
        {schema}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>Field types you will meet:</p>

      <Table
        head={['Type', 'Meaning']}
        rows={[
          [<code key="a">string</code>, 'Free text. Usually the prompt or a title.'],
          [<code key="b">enum</code>, 'One of a fixed list in options. Anything else is rejected.'],
          [<code key="c">boolean</code>, 'A switch, almost always with a sensible default.'],
          [<code key="d">integer</code>, 'A count.'],
          [<code key="e">number</code>, 'A decimal, typically a threshold.'],
          [<code key="f">array</code>, 'A list of values.'],
          [<code key="g">object</code>, 'Structured input for a step that needs more than a scalar.'],
          [
            <code key="h">artifactReference</code>,
            'The id of an existing artifact to feed into this run.',
          ],
        ]}
      />

      <Callout title="Defaults are applied, not assumed" tone="tip">
        A field with a <code>default</code> is filled in for you when you omit it, and the value that was
        used is recorded on the run. You never have to send a field just to get its default, and you can
        always see afterwards what the run actually ran with.
      </Callout>

      <h2>When it does not validate</h2>
      <p>
        Every problem is named, so you should never have to guess which field was wrong. This is the
        single most common error against the API.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="POST /v1/runs" language="json">
        {invalid}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Unknown keys are currently logged rather than rejected — do not rely on that as permission to
        send extra fields. See <Link href="/docs/errors">Errors</Link> for the full list.
      </p>

      <h2>Artifact inputs</h2>
      <p>
        Some workflows take another artifact as input — an infographic built from a research report, an
        edit applied to an existing image. Those fields have type{' '}
        <code>artifactReference</code> and usually constrain the <code>artifactType</code> they accept.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="an artifactReference field" language="json">
        {artifactRef}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        You pass an artifact id, and Esy checks that it exists, that it is the right type, and that it is
        inside a workspace you can reach — before the run starts. A workflow can also declare that a step
        may <em>produce</em> the input if you do not supply one; see{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/guides/compose-with-artifact-inputs">Compose with artifact inputs</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>The rule behind the schemas</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have read a few intake schemas, you will notice something: they ask for results, not
        methods. That is deliberate, and it is the design rule that explains most of what you will
        otherwise find arbitrary.
      </p>

      <p>Every run answers two questions, and they belong to different layers:</p>

      <p>
        You ask for &ldquo;a picture with a see-through background&rdquo;. Whether the model renders
        transparency directly or Esy renders normally and keys the background out afterwards is a
        kitchen decision — it depends on which model is bound today and what that model can do.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it is built this way</h2>
      <p>
        A mechanism field fails twice over. First, it asks you a question already settled by the model
        binding, so wrong combinations simply break runs. Second, and worse, it makes saved intakes rot.
      </p>

      <Table
        head={['A saved intake that says…', 'In a year']}
        rows={[
          [
            <em key="a">&ldquo;I want a transparent background&rdquo;</em>,
            'Still exactly what you wanted. The engine picks whatever is best by then.',
          ],
          [
            <em key="b">&ldquo;Run the background-removal step&rdquo;</em>,
            'Actively worse: it forces an extra paid step that a newer model made unnecessary.',
          ],
        ]}

      <Callout title="The test for a new capability" tone="note">
        <p>
          A new <strong>promise</strong> — something the workflow could not deliver before — is a
          template change and a new version. A better <strong>mechanism</strong> for a promise already
          made is not: it is a capability flag on the model, conditional logic in the step, and a
          provenance entry. Your saved intakes keep working and quietly get better.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <h2>Seeing what was actually used</h2>
      <p>
        Because the engine makes these choices, it also records them. A finished run carries the resolved
        intake — defaults filled in — and the artifact records the mechanism chosen, for instance{' '}
        <code>transparencyMechanism: &quot;native&quot;</code> versus <code>&quot;post-process&quot;</code>. If you need to
        know why two runs of the same workflow behaved differently, that is where to look.
