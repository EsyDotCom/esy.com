            Every response body on this page was captured from <code>api.esy.com</code>, not invented.
            Two things are worth knowing up front: errors always arrive under a <code>detail</code> key,
            and a run that <em>fails</em> is not an API error — it is a successful request describing
            unsuccessful work.
          </>
        }
      />

      <h2>The shape</h2>
      <p>
        Esy is a FastAPI service, so every error body has a single top-level <code>detail</code>. It is
        sometimes a string and sometimes an object — always check the type before reading into it.

      <h2>422 — the one you will hit most</h2>
      <p>
        There are two different <code>422</code>s and they look nothing alike. The first is the{' '}
        <strong>intake contract</strong>: your <code>intake</code> did not match what the workflow
        declares. <code>detail.fields</code> names each problem in plain language.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="POST /v1/runs — missing required intake" language="json">
        {intakeInvalid}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        The second is FastAPI&rsquo;s own request validation, for a malformed query string or body. Here{' '}
        <code>detail</code> is an <em>array</em>, and <code>loc</code> tells you where the problem is.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/budgets — missing query parameter" language="json">
        {validationShape}
      </CodeBlock>

      <Callout title="Check the type of detail" tone="tip">
        <code>detail</code> can be a string, an object, or an array depending on which layer rejected
        you. A client that assumes one shape will throw while handling an error, which is the worst
        moment to throw. Branch on <code>typeof</code> / <code>Array.isArray</code> first.
      </Callout>

      <p>
        The reliable way to avoid intake errors is to read the contract before you call:{' '}
        <code>GET /v1/catalog/workflows/{'{id}'}</code> returns the <code>intakeSchema</code> with every
        field, its type, whether it is required, its default, and its allowed values. See{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/api/workflows">Workflows and catalog</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>402 — a budget said no</h2>
      <p>
        Budgets are enforced <em>before</em> the run starts, against the estimate. A refused run spends
        nothing, and the refusal is recorded so you can query it later.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="POST /v1/runs — refused" language="json">
        {budgetExceeded}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        <code>reason</code> tells you which rule fired: <code>per_run_cap_exceeded</code>,{' '}
        <code>hard_stop</code>, <code>allow_overage_exceeded</code>, or{' '}
        <code>allow_one_more_exhausted</code>. The rest of the body is everything you need to render a
        useful message — you know the limit, the spend, and what this run would have cost.{' '}
        <Link href="/docs/concepts/costs">Costs and budgets</Link> explains the enforcement modes.
      </p>

      <h2>400 — the template moved on</h2>
      <p>
        Workflows are deprecated rather than deleted, and the refusal names its successor so you can
        migrate without going hunting.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="POST /v1/runs — deprecated template" language="json">
        {deprecated}
      </CodeBlock>

      <h2>A failed run is not an API error</h2>
      <p>
        This is the distinction that matters most for your error handling. If{' '}
        <code>POST /v1/runs</code> returns <code>201</code>, the request succeeded. The{' '}
        <em>work</em> can still fail afterwards, and you learn that by reading the run&rsquo;s{' '}
        <code>status</code> — not by catching an exception.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="GET /v1/runs/{run_id} — the work failed" language="json">
        {runFailure}
      </CodeBlock>

      <p>
        Two things to notice. <code>error</code> carries the actual verdict, including the gate&rsquo;s
        reasoning — here an OCR gate rejecting lettering the model invented. And{' '}
        <code>totalCosts.actualUsd</code> is non-zero: <strong>a failed run still costs money</strong>,
        because the provider calls before the failure really happened. Budget for failures, not just for
        successes.
      </p>

      <Callout title="Terminal is not the same as successful" tone="warning">
        Treat <code>completed</code>, <code>review</code>, <code>failed</code>, <code>cancelled</code>,{' '}
        <code>rejected</code> and <code>changes_requested</code> as &ldquo;stop waiting&rdquo;. Only{' '}
        <code>completed</code> means you have a finished artifact. A run in <code>review</code> produced
        something, but a human has not accepted it yet.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Retrying</h2>
      <p>
        Reads are safe to retry. Writes are not: Esy does not yet enforce idempotency keys on{' '}
        <code>POST /v1/runs</code>, so a blind retry after a timeout can start the work twice and bill
        you twice. If a write times out, look for what you created before you try again.
      </p>

      <CodeBlock title="a retry policy that will not double-bill" language="typescript">
